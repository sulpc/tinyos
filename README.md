# tinyos

TinyOS is a simple RTOS, similar to FreeRTOS, Î¼COS, etc., implemented on CM3 and RH850 platforms.

In addition to the OS kernel, some utility modules such as CLI, heap, log, ringbuffer, etc. are provided in this demo. TinyOS itself will also use these.

TinyOS has not been fully tested, only for learning and entertainment.
